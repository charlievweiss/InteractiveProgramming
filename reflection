# Technical Review Reflection
by Charlie Weiss

### Feedback and Decisions
My key questions were presented and answered as follows:
- How do I make this time-based, rather than counter-based, which changes depending on the system?
There are two ways to do this: 1) Set a goal for frames per second. Check how much time has passed since the last update, and if too little time has passed, tell it to wait until enough time has and update then.
